## Deep learning

**Team:** Blake Richards, Jessica Thomson, Joseph Viviano, Yu Zhang

**Date:** November 15th, 2019, 9h-17h. Breakfast/registration at 8h30.

**Summary:** Deep learning is increasingly used in neuroscience research. This course is an introduction to deep learning geared towards neuroscientists, with the aim of gaining a basic understanding of:
* principles of a deep neural network architecture.
* convolutional neural networks.
* variational auto-encoders.
* graph convolutional neural networks.

In addition, a key objective of the course is to gain an understanding of how deep learning can be used for neuroscience research. Current approaches to link artificial and biological neural networks will thus be reviewed, and hands-on tutorials using neuro data will illustrate most of the presented notions.

**Morning (9h-12h30)**: *Foundation of deep learning*

```
9:00 am – 10:30 am: Deep Learning and convolutional networks (Joseph Viviano)
10:30 am – 11:00 am: Break
11:00 am – 12:30 pm: Variational auto-encoders (Blake Richards)
12:30 pm - 1:30 pm: Lunch
```

**Afternoon (13h30-17h)** *intersection of deep learning and neuroscience*
```
13:30 pm – 15:00 pm: Comparing the activity of artificial and biological networks (Jessica Thompson)
15:00 pm – 15:30 pm: Break
15:30 pm – 17:00 pm: (Brain) graph convolutional networks (Yu Zhang)
```

**Prerequisites**

- Basic familiarity with Python would be preferable
- You will need enough space for Anaconda and all the course data (~4GB).

Detailed installation instructions for the tutorials will be made available soon.
